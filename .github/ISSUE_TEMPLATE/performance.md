## Performance Issue
A clear and concise description of the performance problem.

## Current Performance
Describe the current performance characteristics:
- **Response Time**: [e.g., 5 seconds for a simple prompt]
- **Memory Usage**: [e.g., 500MB RAM]
- **CPU Usage**: [e.g., 100% CPU during operation]
- **Network**: [e.g., slow API calls, timeouts]

## Expected Performance
Describe what performance you expect:
- **Response Time**: [e.g., under 1 second for simple prompts]
- **Memory Usage**: [e.g., under 100MB RAM]
- **CPU Usage**: [e.g., minimal CPU usage]
- **Network**: [e.g., efficient API calls]

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run command: `ai-cli ...`
2. Observe performance issue: `...`

## Environment
- **OS**: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14.0, Windows 11]
- **Hardware**: [e.g., 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU, SSD]
- **Network**: [e.g., local API, remote API, slow connection]
- **Model**: [e.g., llama3, gpt-4, etc.]
- **Input Size**: [e.g., 1KB text, 10MB file]

## Command Used
```bash
# The exact command that shows the performance issue
